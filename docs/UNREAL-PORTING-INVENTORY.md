## Rule

A system is not marked **Ported** merely because an Unreal class exists. It becomes **Parity verified** only when its documented Unity behaviour has passed the corresponding Unreal QA scenario.


## v00.02.57 gameplay inventory additions

- Mission anchors: finite Attack + persistent leaf Defend reassert.
- Navigation obstacles: Building/Fence/Fieldworks/Generic detour actor.
- Terrain: slope validation, uphill/downhill speed effect and waypoint-Z following.
- Officer profile + command-delay delivery.
- Fatigue/experience condition model.
- Contact memory + current-contact fire authority.
- Recon: SPEJD HER Seek/Recon/Contact/Screen/Report/LastKnown.
- Cavalry: finalized base defaults, reform charge gate, non-charging screen AI.
- OOB attachment backend: CurrentCommandParent tasking with OrganicParent preservation.
- Bridge occupancy/queue authority.
- Autonomous opposition company AI.
- Routed fallback + rally recovery.
- Ammunition exhaustion/resupply.

- Directional building/fence/fieldwork cover.
- Hasty fieldworks construction.
- Black-powder smoke LOS/accuracy simulation.
- Skirmisher detachment, five roles, combat density and recall/reform.

- Mission constraints.

### Next inventory target: artillery battery

Planned functional artillery core:
- battery tactical unit;
- gun count and crew state;
- gun calibre/type data;
- deployed / limbered state;
- facing and traverse arc;
- artillery range/fire mission;
- ammunition state and resupply;
- movement only when limbered;
- same command/OOB authority model;
- later limber horses, gun meshes, crews and firing VFX.
